The saying  ***practice makes perfect*** is forever true. One cannot be a professional in his field without wealth of experience. In the field of technology - Software Engineering or Software Development, it takes a lot of mistakes by practicing and building projects to be great at this field. This is why the repository is created. It holds all the projects that I will build myself. Not projects from Udemy courses or School projects. Building these projects would solidfy my knowledge and understanding on the different technologies/programming languages.

> [!NOTE]  
> To make this repository interesting and fun for me, I will play pretend that I am working for a company  
> (KoiGenix Web-Lab.co) and we build various Software and Web Applications for our different clients. 😉

The owner of 1Corner (pronounced One-Corner) restaurant, Ms. Rachel Jones contacted my company to build a landing page for her restaurant. As the Senior Developer, I was handed the project. The tech stack needed was Html, Sass, and little bit of JavaScript. The client and I discussed on the design from the UI and UX team, with the assests (images, context and content) she provided. She was pleased with the design and gave the go ahead to proceed with the development.
